[{"id":0,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/get-started/","title":"Get Started","parent":"IBM SMF Explorer Documentation","content":"IBM® SMF Explorer is a Python framework to access SMF data directly from dump data sets. The framework uses the z/OS® Data Gatherer: SMF Data REST Services to fetch data from a z/OS host. IBM SMF Explorer is a Python library, which means that you can use it to write scripts, embed it into other applications or just fetch data interactively. Additionally the Python ecosystem provides access to a large set of libraries for visualization, data analysis, machine learning and many more.\nThe framework enables easy SMF data record fetching, provides information on selected SMF fields, and serves chunks of SMF data, suitable for different analysis types, that can be selected for further processing. For various SMF records and subtypes, sets of SMF fields are provided to make getting relevant data even easier (e.g. system utilization, LPAR utilization, cache statistics, \u0026hellip;).\nAn easy way to use IBM SMF Explorer is through JupyterLab. JupyterLab is a web-based interface to execute Python interactively and makes data visualization and handling easy. For that reason the IBM SMF Explorer Github repository provides you with a JupyterLab environment to get started quickly.\nCan I use IBM SMF Explorer? There are some technical requirements that are listed below. In addition to the setup itself, fundamental Python knowledge and a basic understanding of the Pandas library is helpful to get you started.\nPython is relatively easy to learn, and if you are used to scripting languages or programming in general you might find the Tutorial Jupyter Notebooks provided with IBM SMF Explorer sufficient to learn Python on the go. Additionally you may find very good publicly available guides and other resources to get you started with Python (e.g. https://www.learnpython.org/ ).\nSystem Management Facility (SMF) records represent a wealth of information that can be extracted to get insights into the activities of your z/OS systems. Novice users like system programmers, data scientists and data engineers might be struggling when trying to understand and interpret SMF data if they are still not acquainted with z/OS. Thanks to the convenient interface to access SMF data using Python provided by IBM SMF Explorer, you can retrieve SMF data in tabular form, which can further be processed for the task of data analysis and machine learning.\nYou can use IBM SMF Explorer stand-alone in Python scripts or use it with the provided JupyterLab setup.\nPrerequisites IBM SMF Explorer has some prerequisites that need to be installed and set up:\nz/OS Host: z/OS Data Gatherer: SMF Data REST Services (requires z/OS 2.5) PTF: UJ07630 See Data Gatherer User\u0026rsquo;s Guide (here) A User ID with access to z/OSMF (connected to group IZUUSER) Workstation (Installation): Python 3.8 or later Git (optional) JupyterLab environment "},{"id":1,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/get-started/installation/","title":"Installation","parent":"Get Started","content":" Install Python Access the IBM SMF Explorer Python package Download package from z/OS host JupyterLab setup on your workstation Get the IBM SMF Explorer GitHub repository Run JupyterLab environment setup Install Graphviz (optional) Update the setup and IBM SMF Explorer This installation guide describes the procedure to set up a working environment for IBM SMF Explorer. This environment consists of two parts. The first part is the installation of the IBM® SMF Explorer Python package itself. The second part is the JupyterLab environment setup. This environment contains the Tutorials and everything required to connect IBM SMF Explorer to the z/OS® host easily. Note that the JupyterLab environment is just one way to use the IBM SMF Explorer Python package.\nInstall Python You need to have Python 3.8 (64-bit) or later installed to use IBM SMF Explorer. Instructions on how to install Python can be found here. In the last installation step, make sure to enable the option to add Python to your PATH environment variable.\nNext, verify the correct version of python and pip by running the commands python --version and pip --version in your terminal. This is necessary because some operating systems have Python 2 preinstalled or require you to install pip separately.\nAccess the IBM SMF Explorer Python package IBM SMF Explorer is provided in two parts. The first part is the IBM SMF Explorer Python package, which is shipped as part of the z/OS Data Gatherer: SMF Data REST Services. Note that this package is not available in the public Python package index (pypi) and cannot simply be installed with the pip command (Python package manager). The second part is the Github repository, which contains the tutorials and setup scripts.\nDownload package from z/OS host This tutorial assumes that you already have the z/OS Data Gatherer: SMF Data REST Services installed on your z/OS Host. The IBM SMF Explorer Python package is provided in a ZIP archive on the z/OS host on which the z/OS Data Gatherer: SMF Data REST Services was installed.\nYou will find the ZIP archive smf_explorer.zip in USS directory /usr/lpp/IBM/zdg/smf_explorer on your z/OS Host. Use FTP or any other methode available to download the archive from the z/OS Host to your workstation. Make sure to download the archive as a binary file to prevent accidental EBCDIC to ASCII conversion.\nWhen you unpack the ZIP archive to your workstation, you will find a smf_explorer directory containing a smfexplorer-*.whl wheel file that will be used later in this guide.\nJupyterLab setup on your workstation Get the IBM SMF Explorer GitHub repository The next step is to download the IBM-SMF-Explorer repository. This can be done by cloning the repository with git or directly downloading it from Github.\nGit Clone Clone the IBM-SMF-Explorer repository into a location on your workstation and enter the directory.\ngit clone https://github.com/IBM/IBM-SMF-Explorer.git Download ZIP Download the IBM-SMF-Explorer repository as a ZIP file and unpack it and enter the directory. After downloading and extracting the IBM-SMF-Explorer repository from Github, you will have an IBM-SMF-Explorer folder with the following structure:\nIBM-SMF-Explorer-main +- .github +- .util +- Notebooks +- smf_explorer // smfexplorer-*.whl from z/OS host will come here ... Then, you must copy the smfexplorer-*.whl extracted in the previous step into the smf_explorer folder of the downloaded Github repository.\nRun JupyterLab environment setup The environment needs to be installed by calling the setup script\nIf you are in an enterprise network environment you might need to set up a HTTP proxy for the python package manager to be able to install SMF Explorer.\nYou can use the pip config files or HTTP[S]_PROXY environment variables (see https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/?highlight=Proxy#using-a-proxy-server).\nWindows(Powershell) .\\setup.bat Note that you might encounter the Path Too Long error during the setup process on Windows workstation. To overcome this, please follow guides here.\nLinux/MacOS/GitBash ./setup After the setup script completes successfully, the JupyterLab environment is ready to be used (see Usage).\nInstall Graphviz (optional) IBM SMF Explorer has a feature to show the structure of a request as a graph in JupyterLab. For the feature to work you need to install a third party tool Graphviz on your Workstation.\nYou can follow the instruction here to install Graphviz for your platform.\nUpdate the setup and IBM SMF Explorer To update IBM SMF Explorer and the JupyterLab environment you should pull the latest changes from the IBM-SMF-Explorer repository using git pull or download the repository as a ZIP file again.\nIf you used the provided Notebooks without making your own copies, the git pull command may complain that there are uncommitted changes. You can delete all local changes with git reset --hard followed by a second git pull. Note that this will delete all the local changes you made. You should download a new version of IBM SMF Explorer from the Host if available and copy the smf_explorer directory into the cloned repository again.\nBy running the setup script again the environment will be updated. If you want to setup the environment from scratch, you can add the reset option.\nWindows(Powershell) .\\setup.bat [-Reset] Linux/MacOS/GitBash ./setup [--reset] "},{"id":2,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/faq/","title":"FAQ","parent":"IBM SMF Explorer Documentation","content":"You can find some frequently asked questions on this page. If you have other questions you may take a look at https://github.com/IBM/IBM-SMF-Explorer/discussions or open new discussion there.\nI want to install my own dependencies in the Jupyter environment. How can I do it? If you want to add your own dependencies, you can create a requirements.txt file in the root directory of the IBM-SMF-Exporer directory. To add your requirements, follow the instructions from the official pip documentation (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#requirements-file-format).\nWhen you create or change your requirements-file, simply run the setup (setup.bat on Windows) script to install your dependencies.\nTry to avoid pip freeze to create your custom requirements.txt file. Using the freeze command could override dependencies that are required by SMF Explorer, leading to a broken environment. My setup does not work or I have issues with IBM SMF Explorer. What can I do? The first thing to do, if you face issues with your setup, is to run the setup command with the reset option. This will reinstall your setup from scratch.\nWindows(Powershell) .\\setup.bat [-Reset] Linux/MacOS/GitBash ./setup [--reset] If resetting your environment does not solve the issue or you found issues with IBM SMF Explorer itself, you can open a discussion on Github or open an issue.\nI get errors about insufficient resources. What can I do? Processing SMF data can be very resource intensive. If you face errors concerning insufficient resources you can take some steps to still be able to request the data you want:\nSplit the SMF dump into multiple parts and fetch the data separately Sort the SMF dump Increase the amount of main storage available to the z/OS Data Gatherer: SMF Data REST Services server.

You can click on the name of a sample to get more details about it. On the Sample Details page, a description for the sample and the fields fetched by this sample are listed.\nThe section Virtual fields lists all virtual fields used by IBM® SMF Explorer for the current subtype. For each virtual field, the origin fields that it is based on and its short description are given. You can click on the virtual field or its origin to get more details.\nThe section Mappings lists all the mappings available for the current subtype. For each mapping, a description and the list of all IBM SMF Explorer fields used in this mapping are given. Each field is listed together with its origin (column Based on), a short description, and its type or format.\nThe following tags denote the characteristics of the fields:\nTag Meaning virtual This is a virtual field. A virtual field is based on other IBM SMF Explorer fields, which themselves can also be virtual. processed This field is postprocessed, e.g. with numerical scaling or mapping. flag This field has several derived flag fields of type Boolean. Each derived field corresponds to a bit position of this field. array This field is interpreted as an array. It has several fields derived from it, each corresponds to an array position. alias This field is an unchanged copy of the field it is based on. If a field is not virtual , the column Based on displays the name of the source field (SMF) that this field is based on. Otherwise, the name of the IBM SMF Explorer fields that this field is derived from is given.\nIf a field is tagged as array or flag , then the indented subsequential fields are its subfields, for example:\nName Based on Description Type/Format flg flag SMF70FLG SYSTEM INDICATOR FLAGS string bfy flg SYSTEM RUNNING IN PR/SM MODE os flg OPERATING SYSTEM IS OS/VS2 Field, Sample and Map names in this documentation are often hyperlinks that point to more detailed information. Field detail page Each SMF field is provided with a field detail page. This page specifies the field description, the map that this field belongs to, and the source field that this field is based on (or other IBM SMF Explorer fields in the case of a virtual field)\nIf the field is postprocessed, for example being scaled, aggregated or mapped, there is a section Postprocessed that describes how this is done.\nAdditionally, the pages for array fields also provide information about the length of the arrays and the derived alias fields. An alias field is a field that corresponds to an element of an array field.\n"},{"id":1664,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf74/SMF74S1/fields/hpc/","title":"Field - hpc","parent":"SMF 74 Subtype  1","content":"Number of HyperPAV aliases configured for that LSS\nMap: SMF74B Based on: SMF74HPC "},{"id":1665,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf73/SMF73S1/fields/hpl/","title":"Field - hpl","parent":"SMF 73 Subtype  1","content":"LENGTH OF CHANNEL PATH DATA SECTION\nRecord: SMF73S1 Based on: SMF73HPL "},{"id":1666,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf78/SMF78S3/fields/hpl/","title":"Field - hpl","parent":"SMF 78 Subtype  3","content":"Length of HyperPAV/ SuperPAV Data Section\nRecord: SMF78S3 Based on: SMF78HPL "},{"id":1667,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf73/SMF73S1/fields/hpn/","title":"Field - hpn","parent":"SMF 73 Subtype  1","content":"NUMBER OF CHANNEL PATH DATA SECTIONS\nRecord: SMF73S1 Based on: SMF73HPN "},{"id":1668,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf78/SMF78S3/fields/hpn/","title":"Field - hpn","parent":"SMF 78 Subtype  3","content":"Number of HyperPAV/ SuperPAV Data Sections\nRecord: SMF78S3 Based on: SMF78HPN "},{"id":1669,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf73/SMF73S1/fields/hps/","title":"Field - hps","parent":"SMF 73 Subtype  1","content":"OFFSET TO CHANNEL PATH DATA SECTION\nRecord: SMF73S1 Based on: SMF73HPS "},{"id":1670,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf78/SMF78S3/fields/hps/","title":"Field - hps","parent":"SMF 78 Subtype  3","content":"Offset to HyperPAV/ SuperPAV Data Sections\nRecord: SMF78S3 Based on: SMF78HPS "},{"id":1671,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf74/SMF74S1/fields/hpv/","title":"Field - hpv","parent":"SMF 74 Subtype  1","content":"=1 If HyperPAV base device\nMap: SMF74B Based on: cnx Post-Processed This virtual field corresponds to the flag at bit-position 6 of field cnx.\n"},{"id":1672,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf71/SMF71S1/fields/hrs/","title":"Field - hrs","parent":"SMF 71 Subtype  1","content":"Number of hipersp. pages read from central storage (long floating poin\u0026hellip;\nMap: SMF71PAG Based on: SMF71HRS Description Number of hipersp. pages read from central storage (long floating point)\n"},{"id":1673,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf70/SMF70S1/fields/hw_cap_limit_chng/","title":"Field - hw_cap_limit_chng","parent":"SMF 70 Subtype  1","content":"SMF70HW_Cap_Limit has changed during the interval\nMap: SMF70BPD Based on: vpf Post-Processed This virtual field corresponds to the flag at bit-position 6 of field vpf.\n"},{"id":1674,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf70/SMF70S1/fields/hwgr_name/","title":"Field - hwgr_name","parent":"SMF 70 Subtype  1","content":"Name of the hardware group this parition belongs to.\nMap: SMF70BCT Based on: SMF70HWGR_NAME "},{"id":1675,"href":"/IBM-SMF-Explorer/mappings/smf70/SMF70S1/fields/hwm/","title":"Field - hwm","parent":"SMF 70 Subtype  1","content":"EBCDIC CPC physical model identifier.
